= Development on Windows

[NOTE]
====
Windows platform support has been tested but is currently not actively supported.
====

== Setting up the Development Environment

=== Requirements

Currently for development on the Windows platform the following
compilers have been tested:

* MinGW-w64 toolchain (a GNU compiler toolchain variant for the
Windows platform)
* Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 or newer
* Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or newer
* Visual Studio 2019
* Intel C++ 2016

A development environment requires the following software
installed on the computer hosting the Windows environment
in which is developed:

* Perl implementation for Windows
* Ruby implementation for Windows

For a development environment using MinGW-w64 the following software
has to be installed also:

* Collection of build tools supporting GNU make based development
* MinGW-w64 toolchain for the targeted environment (i686 or x86_64)

==== Installing ruby

The development environment requires ruby. Please download the latest version
of ruby from https://www.ruby-lang.org[ruby-lang.org] and install it on your system.
The `ruby` executable must be available through the `PATH`.

==== Installing Perl

The development environment requires a Perl interpreter
supporting native Windows file paths (i.e. using drive letters, colons
and backward slashes; not mapped file paths like used in Cygwin or MSYS
environments).

We advise to install http://www.activestate.com/activeperl[ActiveState Perl]
which can be downloaded http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads[here].
We advise to install the 32bit version of the software in all cases as
this matches most of the other tools from the development environment for
both the i686 and x86_64 targeted environments. Using the installer you can
install the software at an appropriate location. The only requirement is that
the `perl` interpreter (executable) must be available through the `PATH`.
We advise to install one of the following implementations:

==== Installing build tools for MinGW-w64

The development for the MinGW-w64 toolchains uses GNU make based
build tooling as is common for GNU compilers.

The required tools can all be downloaded from the
http://www.mingw.org[MinGW project]. As this can be a daunting task,
especially since the required tools are a carefully selected subset of a
the full MinGW toolset (we do not use the compiler toolchain of
the MinGW project itself, nor does it use the MSYS environment), Remedy
IT has prepared a pre-selected package of these tools and made it
available for download through their website.

Follow these steps to install the build tools:

* Download the ZIP file from
http://download.remedy.nl/idl2c++11/MingW.zip[Remedy IT download server]
* Unpack the ZIP archive in the root of the drive where also our product is
installed (f.i. `C:\`); this should create a directory MinGW in the root
folder of the drive, f.i. `C:\MinGW`
* Add the location of the tool executables to the `PATH` by adding the
path string `C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;C:\MinGW\bin` (mind the order of the
directories) to the PATH variable for your user environment (replace
`C:` by the drive where you installed the product is different)

==== Installing the MinGW-w64 compiler toolchain

The development environment for Windows requires native compiler
toolchain executables from the
http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/[MinGW-w64 project]

Currently the 8.1.0 versions of the toolchain have been tested to work. Higher
versions may also work but have not been tested. In addition only
the toolchains providing the Win32 threading API have been tested (not the POSIX
API) and the structured exception handling model (SEH) on win64 (x86_64)
or the DWARF exception handling model on win32 (i686).

Follow these steps to install the compiler toolchain for the targeted
environment:

* Download the toolchain package for x86_64 (win64) targets
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/[here]
or for i686 (win32)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/dwarf/[here]
; select the latest revision of the package
* Unpack the archive in the root folder of the drive where also TAOX11
is installed; this should create a directory `mingw64` (for
win64/x86_64) or `mingw32` (for win32/i686) in the root folder of the
drive
* Add the location of the toolchain executables to the `PATH` by adding
the path string `C:\mingw64\bin;C:\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib` or
`C:\mingw32\bin;C:\mingw32\i686-w64-mingw32\lib` (mind the order of the
directories) to the PATH variable for your user environment *before the
path string for the MinGW build tool executables* (replace `C:` by the
drive where you installed the product is different)

****
The MinGW-w64 toolchain packages are 7Zip compressed archives.
You can find installer downloads for Windows
http://www.7-zip.org/[here].

== Using Windows

=== Visual Studio

Development using Visual Studio 2015, 2017, and 2019 has been tested as well. When you use
<<{parent_dir}/brix11/brix11.adoc#,BRIX11>> to compile the project, the project type will be set
to _solution_ files by default and the _msbuild_ tool will
be used to compile your application.

Due to the way Microsoft pass:[C++] compilers and linkers on Windows (including the Intel pass:[C++] compiler for Windows)
handle symbol exports from DLLs it is important that for a debug build of your application you link the
shipped debug libraries and for a release build of your application the shipped release libraries.
With <<{parent_dir}/brix11/brix11.adoc#,BRIX11>> building for debug or release can be specified by
adding the `--debug` or `--release` (default) switch to the `make` command.

=== MinGW-w64

After you have installed the necessary requirements you can
use MinGW-w64 to compile your application.

=== Testing

When you have installed the required development support software as
described above you can go on to test building examples and tests
as described <<{parent_dir}/brix11/brix11.adoc#,here>>.
