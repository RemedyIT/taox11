= Getting started with TAOX11

== What is TAOX11?

TAOX11 is the CORBA implementation supporting the
https://www.omg.org/spec/CPP11[IDL to C++11] Language Mapping.
TAOX11 builds on the core of
https://www.remedy.nl/opensource/tao.html[TAO] to provide you as
user with a large set of features and capabilities. TAO is a well
known and stable CORBA implementation with a rich set of features and
capabilities.

=== Supported features

TAOX11 has the following major features:

. Compliant with the IDL to {cxx11} v1.3 language mapping
. CORBA v3.3 compliant
. Full support of the IDL type system (basic types, constant, enum,
string, wide string, sequence, array, struct, union, typedef, exception)
. Full support for local and remote CORBA interfaces
. Full POA support
. Full support for valuetype and abstract interfaces
. Full support for Any
. Through POA Collocation optimization

. CodecFactory support
. DynamicAny and TypeCodeFactory support
. Portable Interceptors

=== The IDL to {cxx11} language mapping

The IDL to {cxx11} language mapping is much easier to learn and use than the IDL
to C++ language mapping. The IDL to {cxx11} language mapping brings you
the following improvements:

Integration of standard {cxx11} types::

 The {cxx11} language mapping leverages standard {cxx11} types for all IDL
standard types like the integer types, floating point types, character
types, booleans, strings (`std::string`), sequences
(`std::vector`) and arrays (`std::array`). This mapping provides a great
improvement of ease of use and far better opportunities for integration
with other {cpp}(11) based software (like the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{cpp}_standard_library[{cpp}(11) Standard
Library]).
Have a look at the
CORBA Programming with TAOX11
and Comparing IDL to
{cpp} with IDL to {cxx11} tutorials on the
https://www.taox11.org/documents/presentations.html[TAOX11] website for
more details.

Simplified memory management::

 The complete `\_ptr/_var` concept has been removed (!) together with
constructs like `_duplicate` for CORBA object references and
`string_dup` for CORBA strings. +
 Instead the {cxx11} mapping leverages standardized concepts from the
{cxx11} language for the new reference types based on the standard {cxx11}
`std::shared_ptr`/`std::weak_ptr` semantics for object, servant, and
valuetype references implementing a memory management concept without
any need for developer controlled reference counting, `new` or `delete`.
Other ('old style') pointer types have been replaced by implementations
relying on the new {cxx11} _move semantics_ completely foregoing reference
counting requirements. +
 As you can see in the https://www.taox11.org/documents/presentations.html[IDL2C++11
tutorial], memory management has become much easier and far less error
prone.

API slim down::

 The implementation of standardized concepts has led to a significant
clean up and slim down of the API for standard CORBA classes and code
generated from IDL definitions. This again improves usability and
reduces the learning curve.

Reduced complexity::

 All of the above leads to a vastly less complex programming model for
CORBA applications not only increasing ease of use and reduced learning
curves but also ultimately leading to software with significantly fewer
_source lines of code_ (SLOCs) or in other words; cheaper and better
maintainable software. +

On the Remedy IT https://www.taox11.org/documents/presentations.html[TAOX11]
website you can find the
Programming with IDL to {cxx11} tutorial and the
Comparing IDL to {cpp} with IDL to
{cxx11} tutorial.

== Why TAOX11?

Based on the new IDL to {cxx11} mapping TAOX11 brings you the following
benefits:

.  Development time reduction +
 The many improvements in the new IDL to {cxx11} mapping will speed up you
development significantly because of:
* reduced learning curves as a result of reduced complexity and
increased standardization
* reduced error correction as a result of simplified memory managements
as well as the reduced complexity
* improved software reuse as a result of increased standards integration
.  Costs reduction +
 Your increased development speed and better maintainable software built
with TAOX11 will save you time and (thus) money.
.  Full interoperability +
 Just like the old mapping, TAOX11 applications are interoperable with
other CORBA applications, even if they are programmed in another
programming language and/or are running on another operating system.
.  Scaffolding toolset BRIX11 +
 <<{parent_dir}/brix11/brix11.adoc#,BRIX11>> is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_%28programming%29[scaffolding]
toolset provided by Remedy IT to help you start up your development with
TAOX11. See <<BRIX11,here>> for more information on this.
.  Reusable logging framework +
 TAOX11 provides you a <<x11_logging.adoc#,logging
framework>> based on C++ streaming operators allowing you to easily add
clear and concise logging statements to your source code. This framework
is used to implement the TAOX11 core logging support and can be reused
to implement your application logging while keeping the control settings
separate. +
 The logging framework is highly configurable allowing you to fully
control your logging output and format.

== Developing with TAOX11

TAOX11 reuses both the (classic) build system provided by ACE&TAO which
is based on link:{docs_root}/../../ACE/MPC/docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html[MPC] for
makefile (or other compiler project file) generation as well as the Perl
based test framework used for the regression tests.

See link:{docs_root}/../../ACE/MPC/docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html[this] page for more
information about MPC. MPC makes sure that all compiler flags are set
correctly so that every library and application is built with the same
compiler flags. TAOX11 will also use MPC.

It is *strongly* advised that the GNU makefiles or Visual Studio solutions
for your TAOX11 applications are generated with the aid of MPC.

TAOX11 is distributed as a binary package so there is no need to compile
ACE, TAO, or any other parts required by TAOX11 as well as the TAOX11
libraries themselves.

There are two ways to develop your application with TAOX11:

.  Using the BRIX11 toolset
.  The classic (TAO) way

=== BRIX11

<<{parent_dir}/brix11/brix11.adoc#,BRIX11>> is a toolset provided to
help you start up your TAOX11 development and to simplify building
and running your TAOX11 applications.

BRIX11 provides a common, integrated interface simplifying the execution
of various commands from the normal development cycle.
Additionally it supports generation of boiler plate, starter code for
IDL files, client and/or server code and CORBA servant implementations
as well as generate a (standard) MPC project file and test script
(`run_test.pl` file). BRIX11 is also able to compile and run the
application once all files are generated.

Using BRIX11 there is also no need to set any environment variables
since BRIX11 will analyze your development environment and configure the
environment for the development commands fully automatically. In fact
you can immediately start using BRIX11 after installation of TAOX11 by
calling the `brix11` script located in the `bin` directory in the root
of the installation folder (the only thing you might want to do is to
add the path to the `bin` directory to the `PATH` so you can execute
`brix11` from anywhere).

To build and run the whole test suite of TAOX11, using BRIX11, go to the
root of the TAOX11 installation and run the following commands:

* `bin/brix11 generate make taox11/tests` for generating the build files
for all tests
* `bin/brix11 generate make taox11/examples` for generating the build
files for all examples
* `bin/brix11 make taox11/tests` for building all tests
* `bin/brix11 make taox11/examples` for building all examples
* `bin/brix11 run list` for running the tests listed in
`<package_root>/taox11/bin/taox11_test.lst`

or do this by using one chained command

* `bin/brix11 gen make taox11/tests -- gen make taox11/examples -- make taox11/tests -- make taox11/examples -- run list`

Use the BRIX11 _help_ command to learn more about the commands used.

Another way to run all tests is to use the output of the BRIX11
_environment_ command to create a 'setenv' script and use it to update
your environment with `source /path/of/setenv` (or use the _environment_
command directly see `brix11 help env`) and then execute
`perl $ACE_ROOT/bin/auto_run_tests.pl -r $TAOX11_ROOT -l $TAOX11_ROOT/bin/taox11_tests.lst`
to run the tests.

More information about BRIX11 can be found
<<{parent_dir}/brix11/brix11.adoc#,here>>.

=== Classic development

To build and run a TAOX11 unit test or your own TAOX11 application,
perform the following steps to make sure all needed environment
variables are set correctly.

- Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the package
(typically `taox11_<version>`) and then either

** create a _setenv_ (or _setenv.bat_) script using brix11 by invoking
`bin/brix11 env > setenv` (or `bin\brix11 env > setenv.bat` on Windows)
and next invoke `source setenv` (or `setenv.bat` on Windows) +
 *or*
** (on Linux) use the brix11 _environment_ command directly to update the
current environment by invoking `$(bin/brix11 env)`

Navigate to the root of the TAOX11 test/examples directory, to a
specific test/example, or to the root directory of your application. Be
aware that MPC files are needed in order to generate the GNU makefiles or
Visual Studio solutions.

For GNU Make invoke `mwc.pl -type gnuace` (on Windows use
`perl %TAOX11_ROOT%/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace`).
This will create the GNU makefiles. MPC will iterate through all sub
directories and parse the MPC files. Once the GNU makefiles are generated, invoke `make`.

Execute the following commands to create the Visual Studio solutions for
your version.

- `perl %TAOX11_ROOT%/bin/mwc.pl -type vc14` for Visual Studio 2015
- `perl %TAOX11_ROOT%/bin/mwc.pl -type vs2017` for Visual Studio 2017
- `perl %TAOX11_ROOT%/bin/mwc.pl -type vs2019` for Visual Studio 2019

MPC will iterate through all sub
directories and parse the MPC files. Once the Visual Studio solutions
are generated start Visual Studio and build the generated solution.

Each test in the TAOX11 tests or examples directory contains a perl script.
This perl script runs the compiled test or example. This script can be executed by
invoking `perl run_test.pl`.

=== Libraries and MPC

Building TAOX11 applications requires you to link against the TAOX11
libraries. Making use of MPC and BRIX11 makes it easier for you to link
against the TAOX11 libraries. This <<lib_mpc.adoc#,page>>
gives an overview of all the TAOX11 libraries and which MPC base
project(s) you need to create a working TAOX11 application (BRIX11
generated MPC project files will automatically use these base projects
correctly).

=== Manually compile TAOX11 applications

<<compilation.adoc#,This page>> shows how to manually
compile and link your TAOX11 applications. It gives an overview of which
command line options are used and which libraries are needed when
linking a simple TAOX11 client or server application. It gives some
background information about the GCC options used.
