This program performs a series of sanity check on the collocation
support in TAO.  It also serves as an example of how to separate stub
and skeleton + implementation from the main program.

This test also tests inheritance which has nothing to do with the collocation.

After building the example, you'll get:

collocation_test_stubs.{dll,so}: This library contains stub implementations.

collocation_diamond.{dll,so}: This library contains the implementation Diamond object.

collocation[.exe]: This program performs the collocation test.
