This example has been taken from the book "Advanced CORBA
Programming with C++" by Michi Henning and Steve Vinoski.
The code from the TAO repository has been added to the TAOX11 repository.
This directory contains the IDL from chapter 18 and has been ported C++11.

The original C++ code can be found in the TAO repository at
$TAO_ROOT/examples/Advanced/ch_18.

server:
    The server takes no parameters nor command line options and registers the
    controller object with the naming service.  The server then waits
    infinitely for clients requests.

client:
    The client gets reference to the controller through the naming service,
    makes several remote calls on this controller, and terminates.

run_test.pl:
    The script starts up a new Naming Service, starts the server and client,
    and when the client has completed terminates the server and NamingService.

Running:
    Please run the Naming Service first, then run the server program and
    finally run the client program.
